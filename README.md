# AssortedPrograms
programs that aren't large enough to be their own project (yet), 
usually just tools to help with small tasks or to fulfill a curiosity.

# Evernote Week Divider
small program, just prints out the monday of each week in a custom format
with an evernote divider for my personal calendar.

# Graduated Projects
projects that grew or had enough room to grow to a full project.
